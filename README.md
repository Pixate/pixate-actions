# Pixate Actions

This is the official directory of Actions you can use in [Pixate](http://pixate.com). Actions let you script agains the Pixate editor, creating or manipulating layers, animations, and interactions.

This feature is currently in beta, so we suggest running new actions against dummy or cloned versions of your prototypes. 

### How Actions work

Actions are written using a subset of Javascript, and include most of the language features you'd expect. Pixate Actions use the [Action API](http://www.pixate.com/docs/actions/) to define common actions, templates, or behaviors. Actions allow anyone to extend the Pixate editor, and opens up a lot of functionality for everyone. Think of them as the equivalent of plugins.


### Contributing

We've created some useful actions and will continue to add new ones, and we'd very much love contributions that become official actions for everyone to use. If you have an idea for an action that you think everyone might find useful, whether it be a common UI pattern or useful layout manipulation, please share it!

To share an action, please follow these steps:

- Create your action in your own Pixate account (see more [here](http://help.pixate.com/knowledgebase/articles/500711-12-actions) on how to do that)
- Fork this repo (if you don't know how, [check this out](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))
- Clone the forked `pixate-actions` repository
- Create a new local branch
- Add your action. Feel free to add a new folder if you think it makes sense.
- Commit and push your local branch to your forked repository
- On your forked repository at GitHub, create a pull request (see this [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for more info)
- We will review and let you know if we want to make the action official!
